git add: tells git that you want to include updates to a particular file in the next commit
git add <file>:  stage all changes in <file> for the next commit
git add <directory>. Stage all changes in <directory> for the next commit
git add –p: begin an interative staging session tha lets you choose portions of a file to add to the next commit.
git add .: stage all changes for the next commit

Developing a project revolves around the basic edit/stage/commit pattern.
Git commit: commit files and ask for message
Git commit –m “message” : commit files and use the provided message
Git commit –a: commit files and make sure that only files that at some point have been added with git add will be commited.

Git stash: git stash temporally shelves or stashes changes you have made to your working copy so you can work on something else. 
Please note that stash are local and they are not transferred to the server when you push.
Git stash save “message”: creates stash and gives a meaningful message

Git stash pop: reapply previously stashed changes with git stash. Popping your stash removes the changes from your stash and reapplies them to your working copy.
Git stash pop stash@{1}: pop the stash at position 1
Git stash apply: reapply previously stashed changes with git stash. Apply does not remove the changes from your stash.
Git stash –u: include untracked files in the stash
Git stash list: list the stashes created

Git revert: git revert command undoes a committed snapshot. 

Git commit –amend: amending commit replaces it the commit. Do not use –amend if I have push the changes to the origin version as it may affect other users.

Git rebase: rebasing is the process of moving a branch to a new base commit. 


Git checkout –b newBranch existingBranch: this creates a branch newBranch based on existingBranch and checkout the new created branch.
Git branch branchName: create a new branch branchName based on the current checked out branch

Git reflog: shows updates done to the branches

Git merge master branchName: merge master into branchName

git commit -a
git push origin charXXXX
git checkout PARENT 
git pull origin PARENT
git merge charXXXX or git merge charXXXX PARENT: merge branch into PARENT
fix any conflicts
git commit -a
git push origin PARENT
